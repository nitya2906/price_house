🧠 Problem Statement:
Accurate prediction of house prices is crucial for home buyers, sellers, real estate investors, and financial institutions. Traditional price estimations often rely on manual appraisal, which may be inconsistent and lack data-driven insights. This project aims to build a machine learning-based regression model to predict house prices based on various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, amenities, year built, and more.
By leveraging structured housing market data, students will train and evaluate regression models to estimate property values. The project also includes building an interactive Streamlit web app that allows users to input property details and get instant price predictions—helping buyers and agents make informed decisions.

🧩 Business Use Cases:
🏢 Real Estate Agencies:
Offer AI-powered tools to estimate property value based on features and locality.
Help sellers price their properties competitively.
🏠 Home Buyers:
Get real-time insights into fair market value for desired properties.
Identify overvalued or undervalued properties.
🏦 Banks and Mortgage Providers:
Improve loan underwriting processes with automated property valuation.
📈 Real Estate Investment:
Analyze and compare locations for potential investments based on price patterns.

🔍 Approach:
1. Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values (e.g., lot area, garage year).
Remove duplicate or irrelevant entries.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., location, building type).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze price distribution and identify outliers.
Visualize correlation between price and features (area, location, etc.).
Explore multicollinearity among features.
3. Feature Engineering:
Create new features (e.g., price per square foot, age of house).
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
4. Modeling:
Train and compare multiple regression models:
Linear Regression
Tree based models Regressor
5. Model Evaluation:
Use metrics like:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score
Compare model performance on test data.
